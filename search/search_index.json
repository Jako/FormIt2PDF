The PDF content can be set with the chunk referenced in pdfTextTpl. The PDF style can be set with the chunk referenced in pdfStyleTpl. Both chunks can use placeholders for each form field and a formit2pdf.formfields placeholder for a combination of all submitted form fields. The PDF file is attached to the mail sent with the default FormIt email hook. The FormIt hook uses the following properties. Most of the properties default to the value of the according system setting in the formit2pdf namespace.
